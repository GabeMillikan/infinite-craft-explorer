# Infinite Craft Explorer
![Code_I3hHdBbjxb](https://github.com/GabeMillikan/infinite-craft-explorer/assets/44247924/ceedf0a4-f42b-4c66-8cad-c2615e6408e2)

This code simply iterates through every possible combination of elements, and saves their pairings into an SQLite database.
Additionally, it avoids pairing "numeric elements" since that typically ends up going down an endless rabbit hole of uninteresting numeric discoveries.

# How it Works
### API Integration
The primary endpoint is `https://neal.fun/api/infinite-craft/pair` to determine the result of pairing two elements.
Cloudflare uses some smart technology to block Python-based `requests.get()` calls (even with header spoofing), so instead, this repository uses Selenium.
It does't click around on the webpage, though, it simply runs `execute_script` to fire the request via embedded JavaScript. See `execute_request` in [`main.py`](./main.py).

This code waits 0.25 seconds between requests, and implements an exponential backoff strategy when encountering rate limits (or any other errors).

### Result Persistence (Database)
Elements and Pairs are saved into two separate SQLite database tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS element (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    first_created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    name TEXT UNIQUE,
    emoji TEXT
)

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pair (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    first_element_id INTEGER,
    second_element_id INTEGER,
    result_element_id INTEGER,
    is_discovery INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (first_element_id) REFERENCES element (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (second_element_id) REFERENCES element (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (result_element_id) REFERENCES element (id)
    UNIQUE(first_element_id, second_element_id)
)
```

See [`persistence.py`](./persistence.py) for specific details.

### Finding New Discoveries
To find new elements, you want to prioritize combining "specific" elements. This simply means prioritizing combination of recently produced elements.
In SQL, that looks like `ORDER BY first.id DESC, second.id DESC`. However, sometimes this produces an element _so_ specific that any combination with it
will produce "‚ùì Nothing". Getting stuck in this rut of producing Nothing thousands of times in a row is very annoying, so we occasionally try other elements i.e.
`ORDER BY first.id ASC, second.id ASC` or `ORDER BY first.id ASC, second.id DESC`. Specifically, we pick elements at random with this distribution:
- 80% - `ORDER BY first.id DESC, second.id DESC`
- 10% - `ORDER BY first.id ASC, second.id ASC`
- 10% - `ORDER BY first.id ASC, second.id DESC`

The exact distribution was picked arbitrarily, feel free to change it (or use a different ordering method entirely). PRs welcome to make this adjustable via CLI.
